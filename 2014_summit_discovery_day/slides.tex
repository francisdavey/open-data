\begin{frame}{Norms}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Norms may regulate behaviour
  \item Many schools of thought
    \begin{itemize}
    \item social psychology 
    \item sociology
    \item law
    \end{itemize}
  \item Many definitions
  \item Ellickson, {\it Order Without Law}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Norms Simplified}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Social
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Do people think it is OK?
    \item Do people do it?
    \item Do people enforce their norms?
    \end{itemize}
  \item Individual
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Do you think it is OK?
    \item Would you do it?
    \item Would you enforce your norm?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fan Fiction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Even more complex topic than ``norms''
  \item Comes in many forms (understatement)
  \item Legality of fan fiction is a rich seam
  \item ... which we shall not mine today
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fan Fiction Norms}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Some reported norms
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Fans think it is OK for fans to make fan works for themselves
    \item Fans think it is not OK to commercially exploit fan fiction
    \item Copyright owners are coming around to agreeing with fans
    \end{itemize}
  \item Sources: anecdote, eg
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Stephen Hetcher, {\it Using Social Norms to Regulate Fan Fiction and Remix Culture}
    \item 72nd World Science Fiction Convention
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Study}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Aim: to explore copyright implicating norms
  \item SurveyMonkey 
  \item ``Extended social network''
  \item 7 vignettes with variable text for A/B testing
    \begin{itemize}
    \item 5 questions on copying
    \item 1 on remix
    \item {\bf 1 on sequels}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Questions}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Do people generally think it is OK to do that?
  \item Would most people do it if they knew how (whether or not they thought it was OK)?
  \item Do you think it is OK to do it?
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}
