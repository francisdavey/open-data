open-data
=========

This repository contains material I have used for teaching courses on the law of open data and licensing. The contents should be self-explanatory, consisting (at the moment) of:

* [slides](Slides.ppt) (in powerpoint format) to which I talk
* [a handout](handout.html) containing more detailed notes

If you have any problems with these documents please raise as a git issue if possible, or send comments to me at github-open-data@francisdavey.co.uk
