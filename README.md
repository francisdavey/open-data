open-data
=========

This repository contains material I have used for teaching courses on the law of open data and licensing. The contents should be self-explanatory, consisting (at the moment) of:

* slides to which I talk
* a handout containing more detailed notes

Both are in .docx (Microsoft Word) format.

If you are unfamiliar with github and you wish to download one of the documents, click on them in github and then click on "View Raw" which should cause the document to be downloaded to your computer.

If you have any problems with these documents please raise as a git issue if possible, or send comments to me at github-open-data@francisdavey.co.uk
