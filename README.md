open-data
=========

This repository contains material I have used for teaching courses on the law and licensing of open data. The contents should be self-explanatory, consisting (at the moment) of:

* [slides](Slides.ppt) (in powerpoint format) to which I talk
* [a handout](handout.html) (with [a PDF version](handout.pdf)) containing more detailed notes

If you have any problems with these documents please raise as a git issue if possible, or send comments to me at <github-open-data@francisdavey.co.uk>

The repository also contains source markdown files and a makefile that runs [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to generate the final versions. At present the makefile is likely to work only on my personal laptop.
